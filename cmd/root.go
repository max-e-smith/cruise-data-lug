	data from the NOAA Open Data Dissemination (NODD) cloud on a survey by survey basis.
	This simplifies s3 object retrieval, which will almost always need to be downloaded 
	in batch groups, avoiding downloading each file object manually. 

	get, given a survey name argument or path, will download all survey files or 
	sub-survey files at a given path.

	glance will summarize all files and file sizes for an equivalent get command

	list will display all files that will be downloaded for an equivalent get command

	config can be used to change default bucket name and download parameters.`,
